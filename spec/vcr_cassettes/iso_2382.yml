        Scope This part of ISO 10303 specifies the use of the integrated resources
        necessary for the scope and information requirements for Technical Data Packages
        (TDPs) (see 3.5.28) to be exchanged among product data management systems.
        Each enterprise uses content, format, and the level of configuration control
        as parameters when establishing its product exchange or access requirements
        among business partners. Because of the diverse set of products, product data,
        and lifecycle processes PDM systems support, this part of ISO 10303 allows
        many combinations of these parameters and their values. Using a defined set
        of these parameters, the disclosure of product information needs to be sufficient
        to satisfy the business purpose of the TDP. NOTE 1 TDPs may be prepared to
        a level where the product information is sufficient to evaluate a product
        definition concept. Or a TDP may be prepared to a level where the product
        information is sufficient to enable full design disclosure (see 3.5.9). Requirements
        for this part of ISO 10303 were derived from functions that create and use
        TDPs and reside throughout the product''s life cycle. The key informational
        aspects addressed in this part of ISO 10303 are shared and exchanged throughout
        the product''s life cycle. NOTE 2 Within a product''s life cycle, there are
        many functions that create and use the technical information about a product.
        Figure 3 illustrates the functional usage of technical data within each life
        cycle phase of a product. The largest percentage of the technical data is
        developed in the concept development, concept and validation, and product
        and process development lifecycle phases. The operations and support lifecycle
        phase, for most products or commodities, is the longest and is impacted the
        greatest by the quality and usability of the TDP information. The production
        lifecycle phase typically has the second largest usage of the information
        contained within the TDP. In the production and product process development
        lifecycle phase, TDP data is used to build and deliver the product. NOTE 3
        The application activity model in annex F provides a graphical representation
        of the processes and information flows that are the basis for the definition
        of the scope of this part of ISO 10303. Figure 3 -- Functional usage of technical

        are shared and exchanged throughout the product''s life cycle. NOTE 2 Within
        a product''s life cycle, there are many functions that create and use the
        technical information about a product. Figure 3 illustrates the functional
        usage of technical data within each life cycle phase of a product. The largest
        percentage of the technical data is developed in the concept development,
        concept and validation, and product and process development lifecycle phases.
        The operations and support lifecycle phase, for most products or commodities,
        is the longest and is impacted the greatest by the quality and usability of

        forming part of a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). Interconnection
        is achieved by carrying the inter-PINX signalling protocol over the H.323
        call signalling channel, making use of the protocol tunnelling facilities
        of H.323, and inter-PINX user information (e.g., voice) over logical channels
        established through H.323. Each logical channel usually represents a unidirectional
        media stream conveyed by means of the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).
        The inter-PINX signalling protocol is assumed to be QSIG, as specified in
        ISO/IEC 11572, ISO/IEC 11582 and other International Standards. ISO/IEC 23290:2002
        provides for an on-demand type of interconnection, where a separate H.323
        call is established at the start of each PISN call and cleared down at the
        end of that call. A semi-permanent scenario where a single H.323 call with
        an indefinite lifetime carries QSIG on behalf of many PISN calls is described
        as an additional option. In the scenarios covered in ISO/IEC 23290:2002, the
        PINXs participating in a call are not necessarily aware of the H.323 network
        providing the interconnection, and the features available are those of the
        QSIG network. This is different from a scenario where true interworking between
        QSIG and H.323 (i.e. QSIG-H.323-QSIG) is used to connect two PISNs or two
        parts of the same PISN. In this latter case all networks participate in a
        call on equal terms, and features are limited to those available in all networks
        and supported by the gateways. This latter scenario is outside the scope of
        ISO/IEC 23290:2002. ISO/IEC 23290:2002 is applicable to PINXs that can be
        interconnected to form a PISN using QSIG as the inter-PINX signalling protocol.

        and cleared down at the end of that call. A semi-permanent scenario where
        a single H.323 call with an indefinite lifetime carries QSIG on behalf of
        many PISN calls is described as an additional option. In the scenarios covered
        in <em>ISO</em>/IEC <em>232</em>90:2002, the PINXs participating in a call
        are not necessarily aware of the H.323 network providing the interconnection,
        and the features available are those of the QSIG network. This is different
        from a scenario where true interworking between QSIG and H.323 (i.e. QSIG-H.323-QSIG)
        is used to connect two PISNs or two parts of the same PISN. In this latter
        case all networks participate in a call on equal terms, and features are limited
        to those available in all networks and supported by the gateways. This latter
        scenario is outside the scope of <em>ISO</em>/IEC <em>232</em>90:2002. <em>ISO</em>/IEC
        <em>232</em>90:2002 is applicable to PINXs that can be interconnected to form
        a PISN using QSIG as the inter-PINX signalling protocol. ","matchLevel":"full","fullyHighlighted":false,"matchedWords":["iso","2382"]}}},{"category":"standard","path":"/sites/isoorg/contents/data/standard/00/71/7163","uuid":"f3282149-18f5-490c-8911-0cc4c9eb702c","title":"ISO/TR
